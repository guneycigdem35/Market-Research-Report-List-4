<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Breathing Circuits Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Breathing Circuits</li><li>Semi Open Breathing Circuits</li><li>Closed Breathing Circuits</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The breathing circuits market is categorized into three types: open, semi-open, and closed breathing circuits. Open breathing circuits allow for gas exchange with the environment, providing fresh air but risking contamination. Semi-open circuits partially contain gases, offering some protection while still allowing ambient air. Closed breathing circuits, often used in controlled medical settings, completely recycle exhaled gases with minimal environmental interaction, enhancing safety and efficiency. Each type serves specific clinical needs, balancing patient safety and operational effectiveness.</p></p>

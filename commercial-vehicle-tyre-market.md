<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Commercial Vehicle Tyre Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Tyre</li><li>Bias Tyre</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Commercial vehicle tyres are available in two main types, radial and bias. Radial tyres are constructed with cord plies that run perpendicular to the direction of travel, providing better stability and fuel efficiency. These tyres have a longer lifespan and offer improved traction on various road surfaces. On the other hand, bias tyres have cords that crisscross at an angle, making them more suitable for heavy-duty applications such as off-road driving. They tend to be more durable and cost-effective for certain types of commercial vehicles.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Complex Percutaneous Coronary Intervention Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI)</li><li>Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI/TAVR)</li><li>Trans-Mitral Valve Implantation (TMVR)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Complex Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) involves minimally invasive procedures to open blocked or narrowed coronary arteries. Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI/TAVR) is a non-surgical procedure to replace a diseased aortic valve with a prosthetic valve. Trans-Mitral Valve Implantation (TMVR) is a similar procedure for replacing the mitral valve. These advanced techniques offer less invasive treatment options for patients with complex cardiovascular conditions, leading to improved outcomes and reduced recovery times.</p></p>

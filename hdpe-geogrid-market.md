<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The HDPE Geogrid Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Biaxial Tension</li><li>Uniaxial Tension</li></ul></p>
<p><p>HDPE geogrids are commonly classified into two types based on their tension capabilities: biaxial tension and uniaxial tension. Biaxial tension geogrids are designed to withstand forces in two directions, making them ideal for applications requiring equal strength in both directions, such as soil stabilization and reinforcement. Uniaxial tension geogrids, on the other hand, are designed to resist forces in one direction, making them suitable for applications where reinforcement is needed along a specific axis, such as retaining walls and slopes.</p></p>

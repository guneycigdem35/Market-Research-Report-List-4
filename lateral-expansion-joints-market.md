<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Lateral Expansion Joints Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Flange Type</li><li>Welding Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Lateral expansion joints are used to absorb thermal expansion and contraction in pipelines, ducts, and vessels. There are two main types of lateral expansion joints: flange type and welding type. Flange type joints are connected to the piping system using flanges, while welding type joints are welded directly onto the piping. Both types offer flexibility and movement in systems, allowing for smooth operation and preventing damage from thermal stresses. Each type has its own benefits and is chosen based on the specific requirements of the system.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Portable Mechanical Ventilation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-invasive</li><li>Invasive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Portable Mechanical Ventilation market consists of two main types: Non-invasive and Invasive. Non-invasive ventilation involves delivering oxygen through a mask or nasal prongs without the need for intubation or insertion of a breathing tube. This type is less invasive and more comfortable for patients. On the other hand, Invasive ventilation requires the insertion of a tube directly into the trachea to deliver oxygen. This type is typically used in more severe cases where non-invasive methods are not sufficient.</p></p>

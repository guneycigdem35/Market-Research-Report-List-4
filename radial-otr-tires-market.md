<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radial OTR Tires Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Inner Tube</li><li>Tubeless</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Radial OTR tires can be classified into two main types based on their construction: Inner Tube and Tubeless. Inner Tube tires have a separate tube inside the tire to hold the air, while Tubeless tires have a special lining that seals the tire and allows it to hold air without the need for an inner tube. Both types offer benefits and drawbacks, with Inner Tube tires being easier to repair but more prone to punctures, while Tubeless tires offer better performance and reduced risk of blowouts.</p></p>

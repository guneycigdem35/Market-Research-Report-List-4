<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Temporary Cardiac Pacing Leads Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Unipolar</li><li>Bipolar</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Temporary cardiac pacing leads are used to provide electrical stimulation to the heart in patients who require temporary pacemaker support. These leads come in two main types: unipolar and bipolar. Unipolar pacing leads have one electrode at the tip, while bipolar leads have two electrodes placed close together at the tip. Unipolar leads are more commonly used as they provide higher energy delivery and are easier to place, while bipolar leads have a lower risk of dislodgment and are less likely to cause pacing-induced arrhythmias.</p></p>

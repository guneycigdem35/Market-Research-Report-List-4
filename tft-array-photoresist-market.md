<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The TFT Array Photoresist Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>TFT Positive Photoresist</li><li>TFT Negative Photoresist</li></ul></p>
<p><p>TFT Positive Photoresist refers to a type of photoresist material used in the production of thin-film transistors (TFTs) that becomes more soluble upon exposure to light, allowing for the desired pattern to be developed during the photolithography process. On the other hand, TFT Negative Photoresist is a type of photoresist material that becomes less soluble upon exposure to light, enabling the areas not exposed to light to be developed. Both types of photoresist play a crucial role in the fabrication of TFT arrays for electronic displays.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Titanium Dioxide Sputtering Target Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rotatable Transformation</li><li>Non Rotating Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Titanium dioxide sputtering targets have two main types in the market: Rotatable Transformation and Non-Rotating Type. Rotatable Transformation targets are designed to rotate during the sputtering process, allowing for more uniform film deposition and longer target life. On the other hand, Non-Rotating Type targets do not rotate during sputtering and are typically used for smaller scale applications where rotating targets are not necessary. Both types offer unique advantages based on specific sputtering requirements and target performance needs.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wearable Artificial Kidney Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>End-Stage Renal Disease</li><li>Acute Renal Disease</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Wearable Artificial Kidney market includes two main types: End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) and Acute Renal Disease. ESRD refers to the advanced stage of kidney disease where the kidneys are no longer able to function effectively, requiring long-term dialysis or kidney transplant. Acute Renal Disease, on the other hand, is a sudden loss of kidney function that can be caused by various factors such as infection, injury, or dehydration. Both markets drive the demand for wearable artificial kidneys to provide continuous renal replacement therapy for patients in need.</p></p>

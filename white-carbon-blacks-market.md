<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The White Carbon Blacks Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fumed White Carbon Black</li><li>Precipitation White Carbon Black</li></ul></p>
<p><p>White carbon blacks are categorized into two main types - Fumed White Carbon Black and Precipitation White Carbon Black. Fumed white carbon black is produced through high-temperature pyrolysis of hydrocarbons, resulting in fine particles with high purity and surface area. This type of white carbon black is used in applications requiring high reinforcement and UV protection. Precipitation white carbon black, on the other hand, is produced through chemical precipitation methods, resulting in larger particles with lower surface area. This type is commonly used as fillers in applications requiring lower cost and high volume.</p></p>
